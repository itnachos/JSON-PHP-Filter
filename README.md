This is a php solution to sorting JSON files by query for DevBridgeAutoComplete.  It accepts multiple JSON files and sorts through them for the query.  JSON still need to have a "value" key at the topmost depth of the record in order for DevBridgeAutoComplete to work, however the json is placed into a suggestion format, so that is no longer required of the JSON.  The JSON is sorted according to a key of the user's choice.  Implementation documentation is available at http://itnachos.com/backend-for-devbridgeautocomplete-implementation/
