This is a php solution to sorting JSON files by query for DevBridgeAutoComplete.  It accepts multiple JSON files and sorts through them for the query.  JSON still need to have a "value" key at the topmost depth of the record in order for DevBridgeAutoComplete to work, however the json is placed into a suggestion format, so that is no longer required of the JSON.  The JSON is sorted according to a key of the user's choice.  Implementation documentation is available at http://itnachos.com/backend-for-devbridgeautocomplete-implementation/
A video of the file is available at: https://youtu.be/_3CevG7cvj8 .  Although changes have been made to correct a couple of issues and to clarify code, this is a decent demonstration of what this "backend" can do.  
I added a tar.gz file to be unzipped. It is version 1.1, it fixes a problem where the post/get were not functioning correctly due to a logical error.
